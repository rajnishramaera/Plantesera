            When bad fortune hits hard, one usually looks towards one’s
            strongest skill, as that’s always the best bet to help stay afloat.
            And, thus, Suhana’s founders launched into the production of a small
            line of home-made spices, or “masalas”. The spices were made by Late
            Mrs. Kamalbai Hukmichand Chordia in small quantities every day, and
            sold by her husband Shri. Hukmichand Chordia. The couple used only
            fresh raw materials from the market and customers just loved the
            recipes and the quality of the masalas. There was no looking back!
            By the time the next generation got involved, the business was
            already quite large. <br />
            The Founder couple’s sons Mr. Rajkumar Chordia and Mr. Pradip
            Chordia acquired land in Hadaspar Industrial Estate, where they
            established a manufacturing unit. The product range was expanded
            considerably, including extending the line to pickles and papads. A
            thrust was also given to upgrading technology, packaging, and new
            manpower was constantly hired to keep up with soaring production.
